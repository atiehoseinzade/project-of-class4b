    <h2>What <mark>causes</mark> Alzheimer's disease?</h2>
    <p>
      The causes of Alzheimer’s disease are very complex, but one key part is
      the build-up of two substances inside the brain called amyloid and tau.
      When conditions in the brain aren’t right, these clump up and form tiny
      structures called plaques and tangles. These make it harder for the brain
      to work properly. Over time the disease causes certain parts to become
      smaller. It also reduces the amount of important chemicals needed to send
      messages around the brain. Eventually the brain struggles to cope with the
      damage and the person begins to have problems with memory and thinking.
      When it gets to the stage where these problems are making it difficult for
      the person to do everyday tasks that they used to do easily, this is
      called ‘dementia’.<a
